1. The five mistakes in the map function of megalistmanip.s are ->
    i) s0 stores the address of the node, address of array is at 0(s0) 
    ii) the offset must be equal to 4 since one number takes up one word
    iii) the function s1 might have changed t0, t1 & t2, hence we need a way to preserve their value
    iv) we don't want the address of the pointer to the next node but the address stored at next
    v) s1 itself stores the address, we do not need the addrewss of s1
